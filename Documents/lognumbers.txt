LogDataServer explained

Well this is what i make from it :)

The first three nrs are always 1,0,0 i figure its the server number.
then the 4th nr is one of the following:

0  = get item from storage
1  = store item in storage
2  = get made item (poison)
3  = break item when dura 0
4  = pickup item from floor
5  = make item (@make)
6  = delete item (@deleteitem)
7  = drop item on floor
8  = trade item
9  = buy item from shop / get back item from npc
10 = give item to npc / sell item to npc
11 = use item
12 = level up
13 = delete gold from person
14 = add gold to person
15 = monster/player drop item on death
16 = break item on death
17 = change level other/own
18 = add exp other / add exp
19 = player die.
20 = weapon succesfully refined
21 = break weapon / break refined weapon
22 = take out sabuk gold
23 = add sabuk gold / sabuk gold added by item buying from sabuk
24 = get back sword from refining?
25 = give weapon for refining
26 = give item for refining (belongs with 25)

then number 5 is the map. 6&7 are X,Y
Then comes the Name and Item, then item nr.

But this can be different aswell
atleast the first 3 are always the same and the 4th is what happened :)
