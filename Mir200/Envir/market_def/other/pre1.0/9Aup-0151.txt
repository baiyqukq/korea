I can upgrade Weapons for you for a small fee of <$UPGRADEWEAPONFEE>.\
To make an Upgrade you need <Iron/@Biron>, <Jewelery/@Etc>,
<Weapon/@Weapon>, and <Gold/@Gold>\
Do you have these ready for me?\ \
 <Confirm Upgrade/@confirmupgrade>\

[@Biron]
Iron is a strong metal used for making weapons.\
Iron can be obtained from the mines the higher \
the purity, the better chance of a good upgrade\
My eyesight is poor, so i will take all Iron \
that is in your Bag \ \
<Back/@upgrade>

[@Etc]
Jewelery is items such as Necklaces, Bracelets and \
Rings. The higher level needed to wear, the better\
the chance of the refine working. My eyesight is not \
very good, so i will take all jewelery from your bag \ \
<Back/@upgrade>

[@Weapon]
The weapon i will use is the weapon that is in your hand at \
the time of the request.\ \
 <Back/@upgrade>

[@Gold]
I can't upgrade your weapon for free. As my work is of\
such a high standard i charge <$UPGRADEWEAPONFEE> per\
upgrade.\ \
<Back/@upgrade>
