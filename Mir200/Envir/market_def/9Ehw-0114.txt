你不是已经收到书了吗？如果已收到书，\
请双击那本基本剑术（双击鼠标的左键），\
书会消失，你也已经学到了这个功夫，\
它会使你的能力中增加命中率，\
你的功夫越深你的命中率也就越高。\
现在你可以去比奇省的书店， \
书店的主人会交你更加厉害。 \ 
比奇书店的坐标是323，247，你去吧。\

我是高级武士，很高兴见到你，\
至于你的战士职业，我听向导听了解了很多，\
战士的第一个功夫就是基础剑术，\
练这个武功要求你的级别是7级，\
先练练你的能力再来吧。\ \

Remember that these spirits are evil and they use flames.\
They have wings but cannot fly due to evolutions.\
But they will try and hurt you in any way they can.\ \

They were once minions for the evil god WoomaTaurus.\
