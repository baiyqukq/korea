[@w_t_ok]
Great that you chose to listen.\
I will tell you something about this sword,\
and how me and Vincent can make it.\ \
 <Next/@next>

[@next]
It all started a while back when our master\
showed us a book called FateSwordBook.\
In that book it is said how to create this sword.\
But as our master said that we were not readu for\
this powerfull sword he closed the book infront of\
our eyes.\ \
 <Next/@next_1>

[@next_1]
The only thing we could see from the needed\
ingrediants were that you needed high purity\
Gold Ore. After our master closed the book\
evil spirits came and stole his book.\ \
 <Next/@next_2>
 
[@next_2]
He told us to go find a Warrior that would be\
able to get his book back from these spirits.\
And if this warrior was strong enough to rid \
him from these spirits and bring his book back\
he would send this warrior to me with this book\
to make this FateSword.\ \
 <Next/@next_3>
 
[@next_3]
That is basicly the story about it.\
All i ask you to do is go and see my master.\
He can decide if you are strong enough to\
complete this task. He might be a little sceptic\
and let you do one of his weird mind games.\ \
 <Next/@next_4>
 
[@next_4]
My master also is known as a rather shy man\
that doesnt always want to talk.\
So pick the right time to go and see him.\ \
 <Next/@next_5>

[@next_5]
So my friend.\
Do you think you are ready to take on this\
task, or have i scared you?\

Please come back later and i will have it for you.\ \
